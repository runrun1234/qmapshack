**Tracebacks**

If QMapshack crashes the fastest way to get help is a backtrace. We are
aware that it's not that easy to record one. However if you provide one
chances are good to have it solved very fast. If the problem can't be
reproduced on the developer's environment we will sooner or later request
a traceback.

For Linux see:
https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki/TroubleShooting#create-a-backtrace-of-a-crash-on-linux

For Windows it would need a debug build and running QMapshack in Visual Studio.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

 - OS: [e.g. OS X, Debian, Suse, Windows]
 - QMapShack Version [e.g. 1.13.1]
 - Window Manager [e.g. KDE, GNOME]
