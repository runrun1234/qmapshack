# Contributing Code

If this is your first contribution to the project
please have a look at the following Wiki Pages:

* [Coding Guideline](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki/DeveloperCodingGuideline)
* [Commit Code](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki/DeveloperCommitCode)
* [FAQ about using templates](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki/DocFaqProjectSite)

Sticking to the rules and process will save us all time. If your contribution violates the
process too much it might be declined just because of that.
